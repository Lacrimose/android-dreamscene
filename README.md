Tunes is a music app for Android TV that is powered by Spotify. Currently, it supports logging in through Spotify's OAuth system, loading all of your playlists and playing them.

Current Issues:

1. Now playing card does not display album artwork
2. Music will sometimes stop playing after a song finishes, many times requiring a restart of the app

Possible future improvements:

1. Search for songs
2. Radio options
3. Explore music
4. Spotify Connect support

(NOTE: I have not looked into Spotify's APIs enough to even know if 2-4 are possible. I do know that there is no official API for Spotify Connect)

Feel free to make improvements and send me a pull request, I'll try and merge them as soon as I have time.
